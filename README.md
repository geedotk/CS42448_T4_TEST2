# CS42448_T4_TEST2
KiCAD source

This schematic is for the CS42448_T4_TEST2 PCB, designed by Paul Stoffregen
from PJRC. This board implements six unbalanced audio inputs and eight unbalanced
audio outputs using the Cirrus CS42448 CODEC and two unbalanced audio inputs
using the TI PCM1808 ADC.

Inputs 1-6 have a typical full-scale voltage of 2.8Vp-p
Inputs 7-8 have a typical full-scale voltage of 3.0Vp-p
Outputs 1-8 have a typical full-scale voltage of 3.25Vp-p

This schematic was created by examination of the PCB; it 
was NOT used by Paul for the creation of the PCB, so there is no guarantee
that this matches the PCB. Paul says that he created the PCB by directly
placing the components, so he did not create a schematic for the board.
